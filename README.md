# Metronome Project

This project is the follow along of this [tutorial](https://github.com/musicandcode/Metronome/) (Music and Coding).

## Why this project?

I wanted to see how timer works in applications. I found that it is hard to make a timer that works really precise.

## What if i need a timer in my project?

I recommend you to check this github repo.
EasyTimer.js: [https://albert-gonzalez.github.io/easytimer.js/](https://albert-gonzalez.github.io/easytimer.js/)

This project helps us with most of the problems.

## I want something more precise!

Then you should check this article about timers.
